## Inspiration

The inspiration for the Gender-Inclusive Restroom Finder was sparked by the critical need to enhance inclusivity and accessibility on the University of Pennsylvania's campus. Recognizing the diverse campus community, including individuals with health conditions, parents with young children, breastfeeding mothers, and those who value privacy, we aimed to address the absence of easily locatable gender-inclusive restrooms. The project was driven by the understanding that such facilities are not just a convenience but a necessity for many, impacting daily campus life and productivity significantly. Our vision extends beyond Penn, hoping to eventually expand this solution to all Pennsylvania schools, including high schools, fostering an inclusive environment for students and staff across the state.

## What it does

The Gender-Inclusive Restroom Finder is a web application that helps users locate gender-inclusive restrooms across Pennâ€™s campus. It provides an interactive map that shows the nearest restrooms based on the user's location, detailed information about each restroom, including accessibility features, and real-time directions. Additionally, it offers a platform for user feedback and community voting on restroom facilities, ensuring the data remains up-to-date and reflective of the users' needs.
