            Welcome to Restz, a platform dedicated to promoting inclusivity and accessibility for
            all students in Pennsylvania. Our mission is to provide a solution to a common challenge faced by members 
            of the queer community on college campuses: finding gender-neutral bathrooms.
        </p>
        <p>
            At Restz, we believe that every student deserves access to safe and inclusive restroom facilities. Our web app is 
            designed to empower students by providing them with easily accessible information about available gender-neutral bathrooms 
            around their schools. We understand the importance of creating a supportive environment where everyone feels comfortable and respected.
        </p> 
            <p>         
                In addition to providing information about existing gender-neutral bathrooms, our app also aims to amplify the voices of students. 
                We want to hear from you about where new gender-neutral bathrooms are urgently needed. Through our app, you can vote and share your opinions
                 about adding new facilities to buildings that you believe are in urgent need.
            </p>
            <p>
                By harnessing the power of technology and community engagement, we strive to create positive change and foster a more inclusive campus environment
                for all students. Join us in our mission to make a difference and create a more welcoming space for everyone.
                Together, let's break down barriers and build a brighter, more inclusive future at Pennsylvania schools.
            </p>
